    "# Variables in statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we discussed the details around collecting data for our analysis. In this mission, we'll focus on understanding the structural parts of a dataset, and how they're measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether a sample or a population, **a dataset is generally an attempt to describe correctly a relatively small part of the world**. The dataset we worked with in the previous mission describes basketball players and their performance in the season 2016-2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other datasets might attempt to describe the stock market, patient symptoms, stars from galaxies other than ours, movie ratings, customer purchases, and all sorts of other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "The things we want to describe usually have a myriad of properties. A human, for instance, besides the property of being a human, can also have properties like height, weight, age, name, hair color, gender, nationality, whether they're married or not, whether they have a job or not, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we limit ourselves to the properties relevant to the questions we want to answer, and to the properties that we can actually measure. Let's consider three rows at random from the basketball dataset we've previously worked with:\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](img/rows.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row describes an individual having a series of properties: name, team, position on the field, height, etc. For most properties, the values vary from row to row. All players have a height, for example, but the height values vary from player to player.\n",
    "\n",
    "The properties with varying values we call variables. The height property in our dataset is an example of a variable. In fact, all the properties described in our dataset are variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A row in our dataset describes the actual values that each variable takes for a given individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this particular meaning of the \"variable\" concept is restricted to the domain of statistics. A variable in statistics is not the same as a variable in programming, or other domains."

    "## Quantitative and qualitative variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables in statistics can describe either **quantities**, or **qualities**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the Height variable in our dataset describes how tall each player is. The Age variable describes how much time has passed since each player was born. The MIN variable describes how many minutes each player played in the 2016-2017 WNBA season.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, a variable that describes how much there is of something describes a quantity, and, for this reason, it's called a **quantitative variable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, quantitative variables describe a quantity using real numbers, but there are also cases when words are used instead. Height, for example, can be described using real numbers, like in our dataset, but it can also be described using labels like \"tall\" or \"short\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A few variables in our dataset clearly don't describe quantities. The Name variable, for instance, describes the name of each player. The Team variable describes what team each player belongs to. The College variable describes what college each player goes or went to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Name, Team, and College variables describe for each individual a quality, that is, a property that is not quantitative. Variables that describe qualities are called **qualitative variables** or **categorical variables**. Generally, qualitative variables describe what or how something is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, qualitative variables describe qualities using words, but numbers can also be used. For instance, the number of a player's shirt or the number of a racing car are described using numbers. The numbers don't bear any quantitative meaning though, they are just names, not quantities.\n",

    "In our last exercise, we've seen that the new Height_labels variable was showing labels like \"short\", \"medium\", or \"tall\". By examining the values of this new variable, we can tell whether two individuals are different or not. But, unlike in the case of a nominal scale, we can also tell the direction of the difference. Someone who is assigned the label \"tall\" has a bigger height than someone assigned the label \"short\".\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we still can't determine the size of the difference. This is an example of a variable measured on an ordinal scale.\n",

    "\n",
    "Generally, for any variable measured on an ordinal scale, we can tell whether individuals are different or not, we can also tell the direction of the difference, but we still can't determine the size of the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables measured on an ordinal scale can only be quantitative. Quantitative variables, however, can be measured on other scales too, as we'll see next in this mission.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](img/table2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Common examples of variables measured on ordinal scales include ranks: ranks of athletes, of horses in a race, of people in various competitions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we only know that athlete A finished second in a marathon, and athlete B finished third in the same race. We can immediately tell their performance is different, we know that athlete A finished faster, but we don't know how much faster. The difference between the two could be half a second, 12 minutes, half an hour, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other common examples include measurements of subjective evaluations that are generally difficult or near to impossible to quantify with precision. For instance, when answering a survey about how much they like a new product, people may have to choose a label between \"It's a disaster, I hate it\", \"I don't like it\", \"I like it a bit\", \"I really like it\", \"I simply love it\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The values of the variables measured on an ordinal scale can be both words and numbers. When the values are numbers, they are usually ranks. But we still can't use the numbers to compute the size of the difference. We can't say how much faster an athlete was than another by simply comparing their ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether a variable is quantitative or qualitative is independent of the way the variable is measured. The Height variable, for instance, is quantitative no matter how we measure it. The fact that we use words like \"short\" or \"tall\" doesn't change its underlying nature. The Height variable still describes a magnitude, but in a different way."

    "We've seen in the case of the Height variable that the values have direction when measured on an ordinal scale. The downside is that we don't know the size of each interval between values, and because of this we can't determine the size of the difference.\n",

    "## The difference between Ratio and Interval scales\n",
    "\n",
    "What sets apart ratio scales from interval scales is the nature of the zero point.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a ratio scale, the zero point means no quantity. For example, the Weight variable is measured on a ratio scale, which means that 0 grams indicate the absence of weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "On an interval scale, however, the zero point doesn't indicate the absence of a quantity. It actually indicates the presence of a quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To exemplify this case using our dataset, we've used the Weight variable (measured on a ratio scale), and created a new variable that is measured on an interval scale. The new variable describes by how many kilograms the weight of a player is different than the average weight of the players in our dataset. Here's a random sample that includes values from the new variable named Weight_deviation:\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](img/w.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If a player had a value of 0 for our Weight_deviation variable (which is measured on an interval scale), that wouldn't mean the player has no weight. Rather, it'd mean that her weight is exactly the same as the mean. The mean of the Weight variable is roughly 78.98 kg, which means that the zero point in the Weight_deviation variable is equivalent to 78.98 kg.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other side, a value of 0 for the Weight variable, which is measured on a ratio scale, indicates the absolute absence of weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important difference between the two scales is given by the way we can measure the size of the differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a ratio scale, we can quantify the difference in two ways. One way is to measure a distance between any two points by simply subtracting one from another. The other way is to measure the difference in terms of ratios.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, by doing a simple subtraction using the data in the table above, we can tell that the difference (the distance) in weight between Clarissa dos Santos and Alex Montgomery is 5 kg. In terms of ratios, however, Clarissa dos Santos is roughly 1.06 (the result of 89 kg divided by 84 kg) times heavier than Alex Montgomery. To give a straightforward example, if player A had 90 kg and player B had 45 kg, we could say that player A is two times (90 kg divided by 45 kg) heavier than player B.\n",
    "\n",
    "On an interval scale, however, we can measure meaningfully the difference between any two points only by finding the distance between them (by subtracting one point from another). If we look at the weight deviation variable, we can say there's a difference of 5 kg between Clarissa dos Santos and Alex Montgomery. However, if we took ratios, we'd have to say that Clarissa dos Santos is two times heavier than Alex Montgomery, which is not true.\n",
