We'll then move on with learning techniques to organize and visualize relatively large amounts of data, which will make the process of finding patterns considerably less difficult.\n",

    "## Populations and samples\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, the set of all individuals relevant to a particular statistical question is called a population. For our analyst's question, all the people inside the company were relevant. So the population in this case consisted from all the people in the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "A smaller group selected from a population is called a sample. When we select a smaller group from a population we do sampling. In our example, the data analyst took a sample of approximately 100 people from a population of over 50,000 people.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](img/sampling.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The individual elements of a population or a sample go under many names. You'll often see the elements of a population referred to as individuals, units, events, observations. These are all used interchangeably and refer to the same thing: the individual parts of a population. When we use the term \"population individuals\", the population is not necessarily composed of people. \"Individuals\" here is a general term that could refer to people, needles, frogs, stars, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a sample, you'll often see this terminology used interchangeably: sample unit, sample point, sample individual, or sample observation.\n",

    "## Sampling error\n",
    "\n",
    "For every statistical question we want to answer, we should try to use the population. In practice, that's not always possible because the populations of interest usually vary from large to extremely large. Also, getting data is generally not an easy task, so small populations often pose problems too.\n",
    "\n",
    "These problems can be solved by sampling from the population that interests us. Although not as good as working with the entire population, working with a sample is the next best thing we can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we sample, the data we get might be more or less similar to the data in the population. For instance, let's say we know that the average salary in our company is $34500, and the proportion of women is 60\\%. We take two samples and find these results:\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](img/ss.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the metrics of the two samples are different than the metrics of the population. A sample is by definition an incomplete set of data for the question we're trying to answer. For this reason, there's almost always some difference between the metrics of a population and the metrics of a sample. This difference can be seen as an error, and because it's the result of sampling, it's called **sampling error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A metric specific to a population is called a parameter, while one specific to a sample is called a statistic. In our example above, the average salary of all the employees is a parameter because it's a metric that describes the entire population. The average salaries from our two samples are examples of statistics because they only describe the samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think of the concept of the sampling error is as the difference between a parameter and a statistic:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$sampling error = parameter - statistic$$\n",

    "### WNBA Salaries\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point in the mission, we'll move from the tech company example to working with a real world data set. Our first challenge will be to measure sampling error using this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set is about basketball players in the WNBA (Women's National Basketball Association), and contains general information about players, along with their metrics for the season 2016-2017. The data set was put together by Thomas De Jonghe, and can be downloaded from Kaggle, where you can also find useful documentation for the data set."

For this to happen, **we need the individuals in our sample to form a group that is similar in structure with the group forming the population.**\n",

The method can be also extended for DataFrame objects, where random rows or columns can be sampled.\n",

A pseudorandom number generator uses an initial value to generate a sequence of numbers that has properties similar to those of a sequence that is truly random. With random_state we specify that initial value used by the pseudorandom number generator\n",

    "The variability of the sampling was quite large, and many sample means were unrepresentative, being far from the population mean. In fact, this sampling method doesn't seem to perform better than simple random sampling:\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](img/compare.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The poor performance is caused by a bad choice of strata. We stratified the data by the number of games played, but this isn't a good approach. A player is considered as having played one game even if she only played for one or two minutes. But others play 30 or 40 minutes, and they're still considered as having played one game.\n",
    "\n",
    "**It makes more sense to stratify the data by number of minutes played, rather than by number of games played**. The minutes played are a much better indicator of how much a player scored in a season than the number of games played.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data set contains the total amount of minutes a player had for the entire season. If we make strata based on minutes played, and then sample proportionally using stratified sampling, we get something visibly better than simple random sampling (especially in terms of variability):\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](img/minutes.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We increased the sample size to 12 so that we can do a better proportional sampling for the strata organized by minutes played.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here are a few guidelines for choosing good strata:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Minimize the variability within each stratum.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, avoid having in the same stratum a player that has scored 10 points and a player that has scored 500. If the variability is high, it might be a sign that you either need a more granular stratification (need more strata), or you need to change the criterion of stratification (an example of criterion is minutes played).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Maximize the variability between strata.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Good strata are different from one another. If you have strata that are similar to one another with respect to what you want to measure, you might need a more granular stratification, or to change the stratification criterion. In the previous screen, stratifying the data by games played resulted in strata that weren't too different from each other with respect to the distribution of the total points. We managed to increase the variability between strata by changing the criterion of stratification to minutes played.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. The stratification criterion should be strongly correlated with the property you're trying to measure.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the column describing minutes played (the criterion) should be strongly correlated with the number of total points (property we want to measure). We've covered briefly the concept of correlation in the pandas courses, and we'll cover it again later in these statistics courses, so don't worry if the concept of correlation doesn't make much sense to you now.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've left the code editor open for you to try to experiment with the different sampling methods we've learned so far. One thing you can try is to replicate the last graph above. You can then play with sample sizes, and try to get insights into how variability and sampling error change."

    "The data set we've been working with was scraped from the WNBA's website. The website centralizes data on basketball games and players in the WNBA. Let's suppose for a moment that such a site didn't exist, and the data were instead scattered across each individual team's website. There are twelve unique teams in our data set, which means we'd have to scrape twelve different websites, each requiring its own scraping script.\n",
    "\n",
    "This scenario is quite common in the data science workflow: you want to answer some questions about a population, but the data is scattered in such a way that data collection is either time-consuming or close to impossible. For instance, let's say you want to analyze how people review and rate movies as a function of movie budget. There are a lot of websites out there that can help with data collection, but how can you go about it so that you can spend one day or two on getting the data you need, rather than one month or two?\n",
    "\n",
    "One way is to list all the data sources you can find, and then randomly pick only a few of them to collect data from. Then you can sample individually each of the sources you've randomly picked. This sampling method is called cluster sampling, and each of the individual data sources is called a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](img/cluster.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we'd first list all the possible data sources. Assuming that all the teams in our data set have a website where we can take data from, we end up with this list of clusters (each team's website is considered a cluster) :"

    "Let's say you work for an e-commerce company that has a table in a database with more than 10 million rows of online transactions. The marketing team asks you to analyze the data and find categories of customers with a low buying rate, so that they can target their marketing campaigns at the right people. Instead of working with more than 10 million rows at each step of your analysis, you can save a lot of code running time by sampling several hundred rows, and perform your analysis on the sample. You can do a simple random sampling, but if you're interested in some categories beforehand, it might be a good idea to use stratified sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a different situation. It could be that you need to collect data from an API that either has a usage limit, or is not free. In this case, you are more or less forced to sample. Knowing how and what to sample can be of great use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common use case of sampling is when the data is scattered across different locations (different websites, different databases, different companies, etc.). As we've discussed in the previous screen, cluster sampling would be a great choice in such a scenario.\n",
